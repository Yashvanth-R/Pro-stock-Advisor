# Pro-stock Advisor & IEEE paper chatbots

Developing an Intelligent investment assistant for equity research analysts, the objective is to streamline equity research by leveraging advanced technologies. 
[This involves implementing a Lang Chain for text processing to extract key information from news articles efficiently. Additionally, a semantic search algorithm is required to identify relevant textual chunks based on user queries while optimizing OpenAI API calls for cost-effectiveness. Leveraging OpenAI's question-answering capabilities ensures accurate responses, complemented by natural language generation for user-friendly outputs. Finally, a Streamlit-based user interface will offer a seamless and interactive experience, enhancing usability for analysts]
